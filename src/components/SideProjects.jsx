For abstractive summarization, a deep learning neural network was trained on the CNN/Dailymail dataset using bidirectional LSTM. The model was designed to perform text summarization tasks using a machine translation algorithm. For extractive summarization, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) was employed to generate summaries of generic text using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The entire system was developed using Python Flask and connected to a C# n-tier application for Windows, facilitating communication between the backend and frontend components.",
